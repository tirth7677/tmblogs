But don’t worry, it’s not like they’re going to take over the world… yet. In the meantime, let’s take a look at some of the latest and greatest AI applications around, and see how they’re making our lives easier (or at least, more interesting).\n\nFirst up is OpenAI’s Chat GPT which you’ve probably heard a lot about lately since it’s been the talk of the town and has spurred a frenzy of activity in AI use with over 100 MILLION users added in just the last few months since its release to the public in late November 2022.\n\nThis little guy is a language model developed by OpenAI that can write articles (like this one  – ahem), generate text, and even answer your most burning questions. It’s like having your very own writer and personal assistant rolled into one!\n\nSure, Chat GPT might occasionally spout off some weird, nonsensical responses, but that’s part of its charm. Who needs logical coherence when you can have a bot that spits out endless cat memes?",
